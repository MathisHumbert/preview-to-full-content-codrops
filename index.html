              These are the pretty responsories, these are the dear antiphonies,
              that so bewitched of late our prelates and their chaplains with
              the goodly echo they made; and besotted us to the gay imitation of
              a lordly Imprimatur, one from Lambeth House, another from the west
              end of Paul's; so apishly Romanizing, that the word of command
              still was set down in Latin; as if the learned grammatical pen
              that wrote it would cast no ink without Latin; or perhaps, as they
              thought, because no vulgar tongue was worthy to express the pure
              conceit of an Imprimatur, but rather, as I hope, for that our
              English, the language of men ever famous and foremost in the
              achievements of liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow
              to spell such a dictatory presumption English.

              And thus ye have the inventors and the original of book-licensing
              ripped up and drawn as lineally as any pedigree. We have it not,
              that can be heard of, from any ancient state, or polity or church;
              nor by any statute left us by our ancestors elder or later; nor
              from the modern custom of any reformed city or church abroad, but
              from the most anti-christian council and the most tyrannous
              inquisition that ever inquired.
            </p>
            <p>
              Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any
              other birth; the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the
              issue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the
              nativity of any man's intellectual offspring; but if it proved a
              monster, who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into
              the sea?
            </p>
            <p>
              But that a book, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be
              to stand before a jury ere it be born to the world, and undergo
              yet in darkness the judgment of Radamanth and his colleagues, ere
              it can pass the ferry backward into light, was never heard before,
              till that mysterious iniquity, provoked and troubled at the first
              entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbos and new hells
              wherein they might include our books also within the number of
              their damned. And this was the rare morsel so officiously snatched
              up, and so ill-favouredly imitated by our inquisiturient bishops,
              and the attendant minorites their chaplains. That ye like not now
              these most certain authors of this licensing order, and that all
              sinister intention was far distant from your thoughts, when ye
              were importuned the passing it, all men who know the integrity of
              your actions, and how ye honour truth, will clear ye readily.
